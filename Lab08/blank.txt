 1; A LION LAY ASLEEP IN THE FOREST, HIS GREAT HEAD RESTING ON HIS PAWS. 
 2; A TIMID LITTLE MOUSE CAME UPON HIM UNEXPECTEDLY, AND IN HER 
 3; FRIGHT AND HASTE TO GET AWAY, RAN ACROSS THE LION'S NOSE. ROUSED 
 4; FROM HIS NAP, THE LION LAID HIS HUGE PAW ANGRILY ON THE TINY CREATURE TO KILL HER.
 5; 
 6; "SPARE ME!" BEGGED THE POOR MOUSE. "PLEASE LET ME GO AND SOME DAY 
 7; I WILL SURELY REPAY YOU."
 8; 
 9; THE LION WAS MUCH AMUSED TO THINK THAT A MOUSE COULD EVER HELP HIM. BUT 
10; HE WAS GENEROUS AND FINALLY LET THE MOUSE GO.
11; 
12; SOME DAYS LATER, WHILE STALKING HIS PREY IN THE FOREST, THE LION WAS CAUGHT 
13; IN THE TOILS OF A HUNTER'S NET. UNABLE TO FREE HIMSELF, HE FILLED THE FOREST 
14; WITH HIS ANGRY ROARING. THE MOUSE KNEW THE VOICE AND QUICKLY FOUND THE LION 
15; STRUGGLING IN THE NET. RUNNING TO ONE OF THE GREAT ROPES THAT BOUND HIM, 
16; SHE GNAWED IT UNTIL IT PARTED, AND SOON THE LION WAS FREE.
17; 
18; "YOU LAUGHED WHEN I SAID I WOULD REPAY YOU," SAID THE MOUSE. "NOW YOU SEE THAT 
19; EVEN A MOUSE CAN HELP A LION."
20; 
21; A KINDNESS IS NEVER WASTED.
